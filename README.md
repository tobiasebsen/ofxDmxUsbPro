# ofxDmxUsbPro
Addon for sending/receiving DMX/RDM using the Enttec DMX USB Pro

## Description
This openFrameworks addon is inspired by the ofxDmx by kylemcdonald and ofxGenericDmx by woutgg. Similar to ofxDmx it uses the included ofSerial to communicate with the DMX widget, but the messaging is more extensible and allows for using all the functions of the device. Similar to ofxGenericDmx this addon allows you to set DMX timing parameters, but it adds receiving DMX and sending/receiving RDM messages. And unlike ofxGenericDmx it compiles without linking any libaries.

## Usage
Take a look at the included examples.
